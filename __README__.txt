Hello dear,

This is my results of the data coding challange.

TEST.py contains the source code of : 
	- the application to crawl articles on bbc.com using the crawler framework : BeautifulSoup.
	- it cleanse the article text, author and the headline ( I can cleanse other informations it's just a simple application )
	- the connection to MongoDB Atlas and the ability to add results to the Database.

RESTfull API.py contains the API that can provide you see the Database content wich means the result of my crawler : 
	- In my case : http://127.0.0.1:5000/findAll/

The article URL = *** https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55436136 ***


Honestly it's my first experience doing a crawler application, but I'm always able to learn quickly, so I'm very sorry for being late.

Hoping always to hear good news from you. 

BEST REGARDS,

NFAOUI Oussama.
